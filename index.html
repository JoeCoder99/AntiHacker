     <p>No 8. Dont share your password or personal username with anyone.</p>
     <p>No 9. Download up-to-date security programs, including anti-malware software with multiple technologies for protecting against spyware as well as a firewall, if your OS didn’t come pre-packaged with it.</p>
 <p>No 10. Make sure you're on an official website when entering passwords. Phishing scams – instances in which a malicious page pretends to be a login page for a social media or bank account – are one of the easiest ways for you to get hacked. One way to spot phishing scams is to look at the site's URL: if it closely resembles (but doesn't exactly match) a reputable site's URL (e.g., "Facebok" instead of "Facebook"), it's a fake site. </p>
